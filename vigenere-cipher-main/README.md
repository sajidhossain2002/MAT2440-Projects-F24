# vigenere-cipher
Math Project

## Overview
This project is about the **Vigen√®re cipher**, a classic encryption algorithm. It takes a word (key) and uses it to encrypt and decrypt text. I wrote a Python program that:
encrypts plaintext into ciphertext and then decripts the cypher text right back into plaintext


 ## Source 
This folder has the main program file:
`cipher.py`: The Python code that handles encryption and decryption.

### 3. **tests**
This folder has a test file:
 `test_vigenere_cipher.py`: This file tests my program to make sure it works correctly.
 It checks for the
 1. Non-Alphabeitc Character
 2. Uppercase Letters
 3. Short key with Long Text
 4. Full Alphabet
 5. Empty or Long Keys
 6. Null Input
 7. Non-ASCII Characters
 8. Performance with Large Inputs
