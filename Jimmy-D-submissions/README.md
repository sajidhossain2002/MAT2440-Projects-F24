I did a Caesar cypher for my project.
I ran the code on an online compiler called https://www.onlinegdb.com/
As I did not understand Github very well, I couldn't understand how to use Github 
or where to send the files to post it. The code is also very lengthy as it
included all 26 letters. The variables with listed numbers are there
to help me keep track of the caesar cypher while I was making sure it had worked.
The most difficult part of this algorithm was turning the letters into numbers
and then back.
The organization of the code is not ideal and I could have used betters options.
