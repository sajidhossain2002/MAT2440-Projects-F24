In this code I decided to go with a Ceasar Cypher algorithm, where you can give it a word to decrypt or encrypt by giving it a number of how much to increment by. For instance if type "hello" as my word to encrypt and enter the number 4 for example it will encrypt the word to be "lipps" and if i repeath the same process backwards it will provide "hello" instead.
