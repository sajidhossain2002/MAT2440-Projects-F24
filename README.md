MAT 2440 Final Project Program.

For my final project I chose to do a C++ program that uses 2 basic algorithms, the max and linear search algorithms. Due to the simplicity of my assignment choice,
the only format this project has is the program itself as there is no need for anything extra, as the test for the program is in the program itself under correct 
function labeling. The only thing needed to execute and test my script, is a working complier, even one that you can easily have on your browser as I centered my tests
around making the program as easy to run as possible and as accessible as possible no matter if you have a compiler installed on your personal device or not. 
You also can personally alter the test values to fully test yourself the full functionality of the program, although I personally have already done extensive 
testing to ensure a working program.
